"""
In the calculatePrice(100, 0.07, 0.05) function call, we pass each argument as a positional argument. In other words, we pass the price argument first and the discount argument second.
However, the function call calculatePrice(100, 0.07, 0.05) has a readability issue. Because by looking at that function call only, you donâ€™t know which argument is price and which one is the discount.
On top of that, when you call the calculatePrice() function, you need to know the position of each argument.
